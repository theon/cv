    "summary": "My name is Ian and I love Scala! Currently looking for the next Scala contract! <br /><br /> I introduced Scala to Net-A-Porter in 2011 whilst working in the labs team. Over the following five years I drove Net-A-Porter's investment in Scala, providing beginner Scala workshops for near 100 employees, <a href='http://theon.github.io/cv#opensource'>opensourcing</a> as much as possible, <a href='http://theon.github.io/cv#events'>speaking</a> about Net-A-Porter's use of Scala at LSUG and Scala eXchange. By 2015 Net-A-Porter had 15+ Scala applications in production across 7+ teams.</p><p>Today, at <a href='https://lemonlabs.io'>lemonlabs.io</a>, I enjoy taking this experience to help other companies with their Scala projects through contracting and training",
