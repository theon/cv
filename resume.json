I am currently looking for a Java role in the area surrounding Fleet, Hampshire<br /><br />I've recently enjoyed working in the fintech industry at Barclaycard working on their Smartpay Payment Gateway, whilst <a href=\"https://lemonlabs.io/opensource/\">maintaining opensource projects</a> in my spare time.
